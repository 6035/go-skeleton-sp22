Hello! Welcome to the Go Skeleton REPO.

You will need to modify main.go as well as the scanner, parser, and token files as you see fit. This is just a minimal suggestion for your project's organization. 
Feel free to change and/or add any other files. Ultimately, the only constraint is that the `run.sh` and `build.sh` correctly run your compiler.

Happy parsing!
